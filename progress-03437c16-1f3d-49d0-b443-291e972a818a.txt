# Progress Log
Run: 03437c16-1f3d-49d0-b443-291e972a818a
Task: setrox.com portfolio site — Initialize Next.js 15 project with design tokens
Started: 2026-02-16

## Codebase Patterns
- Project uses Next.js 15 with App Router and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 with oklch color support via @import "tailwindcss"
- Design tokens defined in globals.css with CSS custom properties
- Theme configuration in src/lib/theme-config.ts with type-safe accent themes
- Tests use node:test with node:assert (native Node.js testing)
- Tests run with tsx: npx tsx src/lib/__tests__/*.test.ts
- Fonts loaded via next/font/google (Space Grotesk + DM Sans)
- Framer Motion installed for animations
- Lucide React for icons
- Build command: pnpm build
- Test command: npx tsx src/lib/__tests__/*.test.ts
- Data files stored in src/data/ with TypeScript interfaces
- All counts derived from .length, never hardcoded

## 2026-02-16 11:57 - US-001: Project Setup and Design Tokens
- Initialized Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and App Router
- Configured Tailwind CSS 4 with oklch color support
- Installed Framer Motion for animations
- Created design tokens CSS file with --primary, --background, --card, --border, --foreground, --muted-foreground variables
- Defined 5 accent themes (Purple, Cyan, Golden, Emerald, Rose) with oklch values per PRD
- Set up light/dark mode neutral colors per PRD section 2.1
- Loaded Space Grotesk and DM Sans fonts via next/font/google
- Installed Lucide React icons
- Created .env.example with placeholder values
- Added .gitignore includes .env, node_modules, .next, out
- Created src/lib/theme-config.ts with type-safe theme configuration
- Wrote 18 tests for theme configuration - all passing
- Typecheck passes, build succeeds
- Files changed: src/app/globals.css, src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/lib/theme-config.ts, src/lib/__tests__/theme-config.test.ts
- **Learnings:** 
  - Tailwind CSS 4 uses @import "tailwindcss" instead of directives
  - oklch color space works well for theming with perceptually uniform colors
  - Use [data-accent] attribute selectors for accent theme overrides
  - Node.js native test runner uses assert instead of expect

## 2026-02-16 12:05 - US-003: Data Layer - Projects and Agents
- Created Project interface with name, year, status, tags, liveUrl, sourceUrl fields
- Created src/data/projects.ts with all 12 projects from PRD section 3.3
- Created Agent interface with name, role, model, description, color, icon fields
- Created src/data/agents.ts with all 10 agents from PRD section 3.4
- Created src/data/socials.ts with LinkedIn, X, GitHub links
- Created src/data/index.ts for centralized exports
- All array exports use .length for counts (projectCount, agentCount, socialCount)
- Added filtered exports: shippedProjects, inProgressProjects, archivedProjects
- Added agentsByModel for MiniMax/Kimi grouping
- Wrote 22 tests for data structures (7 for projects, 9 for agents, 6 for socials)
- Fixed existing TypeScript error in ThemeSwitcher.tsx (ringColor -> --tw-ring-color)
- All tests pass, build succeeds
- Files changed: src/data/projects.ts, src/data/agents.ts, src/data/socials.ts, src/data/index.ts, src/lib/__tests__/projects.test.ts, src/lib/__tests__/agents.test.ts, src/lib/__tests__/socials.test.ts, src/components/ui/ThemeSwitcher.tsx
- **Learnings:**
  - Use @/ path aliases for imports in tests when using tsx
  - CSS custom properties in inline styles need type assertion: ['--prop' as string]
  - Keep data files separate from components for better maintainability
  - Always derive counts from .length to keep data DRY
